To identify infants who need revaccination as well as those who need follow-up medical care for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, ACIP currently recommends HepB post-vaccination serologic testing (PVST) at age 9–18 months (1).

MacNeil, MPH3\nWhat is currently recommended?\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine vaccination with quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) of certain groups of persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease: persons who have persistent complement component deficiencies; persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia; microbiologists who routinely are exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis; persons identified to be at increased risk because of a meningococcal disease outbreak attributable to serogroup A, C, W, or Y; military recruits; first-year college students living in residence halls; and persons who travel to or reside in areas in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic.\nWhy are the recommendations being modified now?\nTwo serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines were recently licensed by the Food and Drug Administration and approved for use in persons aged 10–25 years. The evidence supporting the use of MenB vaccines in persons at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence).\nWhat are the new recommendations?\nCertain persons aged ≥10 years at increased risk for meningococcal disease should receive MenB vaccine. These persons include those with persistent complement component deficiencies; persons with anatomic or functional asplenia; microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis; and persons identified to be at increased risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak persons with anatomic or functional asplenia; microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis; and persons identified to be at increased risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal.\n',NULL,0,0,5,5,NULL,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'A 17yo young man comes to see you, accompanied by his mother, for a pre-college health assessment.');
