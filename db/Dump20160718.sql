He did not travel anywhere outside of Puerto Rico before returning to the continental US 5 days ago.

Sharp, TM, Roth, NM, Torres, J, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2014; 63:1121-1128. (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6348a1.htm\">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6348a1.htm</a>)</b></p><p><br/></p><p>Chikungunya and dengue are mosquito-borne, viral, acute febrile illnesses that can be difficult to distinguish clinically. Whereas dengue is endemic in many countries in the Caribbean and the Americas, the first locally acquired chikungunya case in the Western Hemisphere was reported from the Caribbean island of St. Martin in December 2013 and was soon followed by cases in many parts of the region. In January 2014, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) and CDC initiated chikungunya surveillance by building on an existing passive dengue surveillance system. To assess the extent of chikungunya in Puerto Rico, the severity of illnesses, and the health care–seeking behaviors of residents, PRDH and CDC analyzed data from passive surveillance and investigations conducted around the households of laboratory-positive chikungunya patients. Passive surveillance indicated that the first locally acquired, laboratory-positive chikungunya case in Puerto Rico was in a patient with illness onset on May 5, 2014. By August 12, a total of 10,201 suspected chikungunya cases (282 per 100,000 residents) had been reported. Specimens from 2,910 suspected cases were tested, and 1,975 (68%) were positive for chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. Four deaths were reported. The household investigations found that, of 250 participants, 70 (28%) tested positive for current or recent CHIKV infection, including 59 (84%) who reported illness within the preceding 3 months. Of 25 laboratory-positive participants that sought medical care, five (20%) were diagnosed with chikungunya and two (8%) were reported to PRDH. These investigative efforts indicated that chikungunya cases were underrecognized and underreported, prompting PRDH to conduct information campaigns to increase knowledge of the disease among health care professionals and the public. PRDH and CDC recommended that health care providers manage suspected chikungunya cases as they do dengue because of the similarities in symptoms and increased risk for complications in dengue patients that are not appropriately managed. Residents of and travelers to the tropics can minimize their risk for both chikungunya and dengue by taking standard measures to avoid mosquito bites.Chikungunya is an emerging infectious disease characterized by fever and arthralgia. After the first locally acquired chikungunya case was reported from St. Martin in December 2013, CHIKV spread rapidly throughout the Americas, with nearly 1 million cases reported to date. Both CHIKV and the four dengue viruses (DENV-1–4) are transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Dengue is endemic in Puerto Rico and throughout the tropics¶ where these mosquitoes exist, and is characterized by fever, aches and pains, leukopenia, and minor bleeding manifestations (e.g., petechial and gingival bleeding). Whereas DENV infection does not lead to long-lasting cross-protective immunity but rather is associated with increased risk for developing severe dengue after infection with another DENV, infection with CHIKV results in long-lived immunity that protects from future illness. <br/></p>','<p>For more information on chikungunya in the US, see:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6348a1.htm \" target=\"\">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6348a1.htm </a><br/></p>',0,0,5,5,NULL,2,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'A 36 yo man with fever and severe arthralgias','2016-01-18 12:55:15',0),(12,'Do not add water','A 20yo college student presents with a 1-2 day history of a painful and red left eye.

He has been wearing disposable lenses since then and has been tolerating them well. He uses a new pair each morning, usually removing them only to discard them before going to sleep at night. However, he recently joined the swim team and has practice 3 afternoons a week. He was reminded by a teammate that he shouldn’t wear his disposable lenses in the pool.

NAATs are the most sensitive tests for these specimens and therefore are recommended for detecting C. trachomatis infection. NAATs that are FDA-cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens can be collected by a provider or self-collected by a woman in a clinical setting. Self-collected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to those collected by a clinician using NAATs and women find this screening strategy highly acceptable.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2015. 64:950-958.</b></p><p><b>Introduction:</b> Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Heart age (the predicted age of a person\'s vascular system based on their cardiovascular risk factor profile) and its comparison with chronological age represent a new way to express risk for developing cardiovascular disease. This study estimates heart age and differences between heart age and chronological age (excess heart age) and examines racial, sociodemographic, and regional disparities in heart age among U.S. adults aged 30–74 years.</p><p><b>Methods:</b> Weighted 2011 and 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were applied to the sex-specific non–laboratory-based Framingham risk score models, stratifying the results by age and race/ethnic group, educational and income level, and state. These results were then translated into age-standardized heart age values, mean excess heart age was calculated, and the findings were compared across groups.</p><p><b>Results:</b> Overall, average predicted heart age for adult men and women was 7.8 and 5.4 years older than their chronological age, respectively. Statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) racial/ethnic, sociodemographic, and regional differences in heart age were observed: heart age among non-Hispanic black men (58.7 years) and women (58.9 years) was greater than other racial/ethnic groups, including non-Hispanic white men (55.3 years) and women (52.5 years). Excess heart age was lowest for men and women in Utah (5.8 and 2.8 years, respectively) and highest in Mississippi (10.1 and 9.1 years, respectively).</p><p><b>Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice:</b> The predicted heart age among U.S. adults aged 30–74 years was significantly higher than their chronological age. Use of predicted heart age might 1) simplify risk communication and motivate more persons to live heart-healthy lifestyles and better comply with recommended therapeutic interventions, and 2) motivate communities to implement programs and policies that support cardiovascular health. <br/></p>','<p>For more information about heart age, see:</p><p><a href=\"www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6434a6.htm?s_cid=mm6434a6_w\" target=\"\">www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6434a6.htm?s_cid=mm6434a6_w</a><br/></p>',0,0,4,5,NULL,2,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'A 35 yo man who smokes presents for routine follow-up','2016-01-18 13:00:24',0),(16,'Breaking the cycle','A 28yo Asian woman presents to arrange ongoing care for her new baby following delivery.

USPSTF cancer screening recommendations that are graded A or B (indicating that they are recommended by USPSTF) include those for breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and for lung cancer in heavy smokers (Table 1); Grade A indicates high certainty that the net benefit is substantial, and Grade B indicates high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or moderate certainty exists that the net benefit is moderate to substantial. <br/></p>','<p>For more information on current cancer screening guidelines see:</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6412a4.htm\">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6412a4.htm</a></b></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>',0,0,4,5,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'A 63 yo woman seeks cancer screening','2016-01-18 12:53:25',0),(20,'One shot at a time','A 68 yo man with a 6 year history of well controlled, Type II diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C = 6.2% when last checked) and a prior 20 pack-year history of cigarette smoking presents for routine follow-up.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2015; 64:944-7.</b></p><p><b>What is currently recommended?</b></p><p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) currently recommends that both 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) be given to all immunocompetent adults aged ≥65 years. ACIP recommends that PCV13 be given first followed by PPSV23 6–12 months later. ACIP also recommends that adults aged ≥65 years who already received a dose of PPSV23, should also receive a dose of PCV13 ≥1 year after the dose of PPSV23. Among persons aged ≥2 years with medical indications to receive both PCV13 and PPSV23 in a series, including adults aged ≥65 years with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cochlear implants, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks, a dose of PPSV23 should be given ≥8 weeks after a dose of PCV13.</p><p><b>Why are the recommendations being modified now?</b></p><p>To simplify the recommendations for PCV13 and PPSV23 use among immunocompetent adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP recommended harmonization of recommended intervals between PCV13 and PPSV23 regardless of the order in which the two vaccines are given.</p><p><b>What are the new recommendations?</b></p><p>ACIP recommends that both PCV13 and PPSV23 be given in series to adults aged ≥65 years. A dose of PCV13 should be given first followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year later to immunocompetent adults aged ≥65 years. The two vaccines should not be co-administered. If a dose of PPSV23 is inadvertently given earlier than the recommended interval, the dose need not be repeated. <br/></p>','<p>For more information on current guidelines for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease see: </p><p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6434a4.htm\" target=\"\">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6434a4.htm</a><br/></p>',0,0,5,5,NULL,2,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Preventing invasive pneumococcal disease in a 68 yo man','2016-01-18 12:56:06',0),(21,'Sample Case','No content yet....','2016-01-08 16:24:55','2016-04-01 04:00:00','<p>No content yet.<br/></p>','<p>No abstract yet.<br/></p>','<p>No additional information yet.<br/></p>',0,0,0,5,NULL,1,0,'2016-04-01 04:00:00',NULL,NULL,'This case has yet to be created','2016-01-11 17:33:20',0),(22,'Sample Case 2','Case overview...','2016-01-11 17:35:38','2016-07-01 04:00:00','<p>Case overview<br/></p>','<p>Abstract<br/></p>','<p>Additional Info 2<br/></p>',0,0,0,5,NULL,1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Case in development','2016-01-11 17:35:38',0);
